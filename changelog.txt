EvenBetterGUI Version 1.1.0 - for 1.20.4-1.21.5 [01/04/2025]
Description: Added colored fish buckets for 1.21.5, added 5 new hunger varients, added custom enchantment books, fixed some heart textures, smoothed some other bugs out.
Detailed change log for version 1.1.0: 
[Additions]
  - Added 5 new hunger varients
    - Added Apple, Golden Apple, Enchanted Golden Apple, Tropical Fish and Clay Balls to the hunger bar selector through Respackopts [Mod]
    - All also have AppleSkin support
  - Added colored fish buckets for Axolotls and Tropical fish, for 1.21.5 as it uses new features and needs Respackopts [Mod] so you can enable it
    - Doesn't support baby axolotls, small or large cod and salmon (yet)
  - Added jump bar when using horses, donkeys, mules, camels. (Oops just forgot about this I guess)
  - Added custom enchantment book textures required you to be in 1.21.5 and needs Respackopts [Mod] so you can enable it
    - Adds 42 unique textures for each enchantment (6 are animated!)
  - Added social reporting screen textures (another oopsie)

[Removals]
  - Removed styled hotbar selectors [instead im focusing on adding more highlight colors in a future update]

[Fixes]
  - Fixed heart textures
    - Frozen hearts, extra hearts, and vehicle hearts.
  - Fixed respackopts.json5 having incorrect entry names that were not in camelCase 
    - This should help solve some unexpected issues
  - Pack format change: 29 -> 22
    - This allows people using 1.20.4 to apply the pack without that annoying "this is for older/newer version" screen
    - This was a mistake that I missed before full release
